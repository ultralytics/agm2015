## üéØ Introduction

Welcome to the AntiNeutrino Global Map (AGM) 2015 production code repository. This project represents an innovative endeavor by [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) to visualize and analyze antineutrino emissions across the globe, contributing valuable insights to fields like [geoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoscience) and [particle physics](https://home.cern/science/physics/particle-physics). The map produced by this code provides a unique view of antineutrino emissions, capturing data from both natural and artificial sources, showcasing the power of [data visualization](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/data-visualization) in scientific research.

## üìñ Description

This repository hosts the production code for AGM2015, an impactful scientific study detailed in the paper **"AGM2015: Antineutrino Global Map 2015,"** published in Scientific Reports. This research enhances our understanding of antineutrino emissions and their distribution around the Earth.

- **Paper**: S.M. Usman, G.R. Jocher, S.T. Dye, W.F. McDonough, and J.G. Learned - [Read the paper on Nature Scientific Reports](https://idp.nature.com/authorize?response_type=cookie&client_id=grover&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fsrep13945)

For additional context on the study's significance, you can refer to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Press Release:

## üì¶ Requirements

To execute the code in this repository, you will need [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version 2018a or newer. Additionally, ensure you clone and include the following dependent repositories from Ultralytics:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/nudar
```

After cloning, add these repositories to your MATLAB path using the following commands:

```matlab
addpath(genpath('/your_path_to/functions-matlab'));
addpath(genpath('/your_path_to/nudar'));
```

Please ensure you have the following essential MATLAB toolboxes installed:

- [`Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox`](https://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html)
- [`Signal Processing Toolbox`](https://www.mathworks.com/products/signal.html)
- [`Mapping Toolbox`](https://www.mathworks.com/products/mapping.html)

These toolboxes provide necessary functions for data analysis, signal processing, and geographical mapping required by the AGM2015 code. For more information on managing MATLAB environments, consult the [official MathWorks documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/what-is-the-matlab-path.html).

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Code

To generate the AGM2015 output using the provided code, simply execute the following command within your MATLAB environment:

```matlab
fcnrunAGM
```

This command initiates the script that processes the data and recreates the Antineutrino Global Map based on the 2015 study. The process leverages various functions from the included repositories and toolboxes. Explore the [Ultralytics documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) for more examples of scientific computing projects.
